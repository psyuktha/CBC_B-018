Karnataka CM has announced that the state govt. will fulfill commitment of paying Rs. 46,000 crore under Farm Loan Waiver Scheme. Now the state govt. is going for one stroke implementation to completely waive off loans of farmers under Farmer Loan Waiver Scheme in the upcoming Karnataka second Budget 2019-20 scheduled to be presented on 8th February 2019.
Previously, the state govt. planned to complete the farm loan waiver scheme in 4 stages. But after the relentless attack on CM by PM Narendra Modi, who termed it as only a “lollipop” for insignificant number of farmers, the state govt. has decided to do so. 
The state govt. is working hard to resolve the long term demand of waiving loans of farmers. In the upcoming budget, CM will clear the complete loan waiver and now it will not take 4 years. Hence the primary focus is to make it clear that it is not only a lollipop but it is a major step towards the welfare of farmers.



(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Karnataka Farm Loan Waiver Scheme – Single Phase Implementation
Now the Karnataka Farm Loan Waiver Scheme is going to be implemented in one stroke with required allocation in the second budget for FY 2019-2020. While the state govt. had earlier decided to complete the Farmer Loan Waiver process 4 stages. CM Kumaraswamy also reacted to the comment of Union minister Rajnath Singh which stated that the state govt. had promised complete loan waiver to farmers but was only issuing notice to farmers for loan recovery.
CM said that notices are only being issued by the various nationalized banks which comes under the control of central govt. which shows the mean mentality of the central government. This shows that the Modi led NDA govt. is taking the issue of solving farmers worries so lightly. On 8 February 2019, the state govt. will present its new budget of 2019-2020 and now loan waiver will not be taken to 4 stages, instead it would be completed in a single phase.


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

It is imperative to note that it would be done without violating the fiscal responsibility. CM will prove that with complete allocation of money for Farmer Loan Waiver Scheme, govt. is committed to the welfare of farmers. The state govt. had announced Rs. 46,000 crore loan waiver scheme in July 2018 but it was having certain issues particularly related to nationalized banks. After its complete implementation, the state’s scheme will become a role model for other states in the days to come.
Till date, there is a tedious task of waiving off Rs. 46,000 crore farm loan from nationalized and cooperative banks. For this purpose, CM has created a separate cell and even appointed an IAS officer to work on this for 24 hours. CM office (CMO) is consistently tracking the progress on a daily basis and is working effectively to ensure that loan waiver benefits reaches every farmer across the state.
Till 11 January 2019, the farm loan waiver has already reached around 1,70,000 farmers and the state govt. has already released Rs. 900 crore. In the 1st Budget, the state govt. has allocated Rs. 9,000 crore for loan waiver scheme in the first year. By 31 January 2019, approx. 11 to 12 lakh farmers will get the loan waiver benefits. CM said that a comparison should be made between the farm loan waiver schemes of various states like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh. Karnataka Farm Loan Waiver Scheme is surely a role model as the farmers got benefited in a lesser time span.
The state govt. was holding discussions with the nationalized banks, and the govt. was expecting some relaxation in the backdrop of one time settlement plan. Out of the Rs. 9,500 crore loan waiver details of the cooperative banks that the state govt. has, some were false claims. According to the guidelines, farmers needs to submit some documents in order to find out the people who are misusing it and to eliminate them. Karnataka Farm Loan Waiver Scheme implementation is the biggest achievement of the state government so far.

Background for Prabhudha Scheme
Though there was funding for SC/ST students to study abroad since 2001, only 287 students have availed benefits till 2018. This is because the students with 49% to 51% score in qualifying exams like GRE / GMAT / SAT were funded. The state government had spent around Rs. 58 crore under the Prabuddha scheme so far. This is a pioneering move and the Prabhudha scheme will enable students from depressed classes to realize their dream.
Access to education for SC / ST is limited due to lack of funds and social pressures. With this Prabuddha scheme, govt. wants that more students can avail scheme benefit and contribute towards improving their own lives as well as the communities from where they comes from and of the entire state.
The scholarship funds would be distributed equally to ensure that the scheme remains fair and transparent to all applicants. A student is eligible to apply for the scheme for 1 time only whether it is for UG, PG or PhD courses. From a single family, maximum 2 students can apply for the scholarship scheme. This scheme will realize the dream of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar of an enlightened India, Prabhuddha Bharat and would enable students to broaden their horizons for the betterment of the society.

State Government of Kerala is planning to introduce a new scheme for migrant labourers in the state. The scheme will cover over 2.5 million migrant labourers mostly from West Bengal, Bihar and the northeast.
According to the latest survey undertaken in 2013, there were about 2.5 million migrant labourers in the state who have come from other states to work here. The government is planning to capture the details of the migrant labourers through the insurance scheme. However, there are rules in the state that every migrant labourer should register himself/herself in the police station nearest to their residence.
At present, the number of migrant labourers is even high and increasing, so are the cases registered against them. About 10% of all the migrant labourers have criminal records in their home states and that is repeated here. 



(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

The proposed insurance scheme is aimed to get the proper registration of all these labourers since the state does not have any proper registration programme.
The government also plans to give the migrant labourers a decent standard of basic amenities by considering them an integral part of the Kerala Society. Special medical camps and basic sanitation facilities at the labour camps will be the part of the basic amenities to be provided to migrant labourers.

=== TAMILNADU SCHEMES ===

Tamil Nadu govt. has started Athikadavu Avinashi Groundwater Recharge & Drinking Water Supply Scheme. TN govt. allocated Rs. 500 crore more in Budget for Athikadavu Avinashi Scheme 2020-21. The state govt. had given administrative sanction to implement the scheme on 28 March 2018. Environment Clearance was given on 19 December 2019. The main purpose of this scheme is to recharge and raise the ground water levels.
The Athikadavu Avinashi Scheme aims to ensure fresh drinking water supply to all households in the state. The main aim is to provide piped water supply to each family across the Tamil Nadu state. An amount of Rs. 1,000 crore was sanctioned for the project estimated to cost Rs. 1,652 crore. A pipeline is to be created for 1,058 Km and 6 pump houses constructed.
A total of 1,048 water bodies would benefit from the Athikadavu Avinashi Scheme to provide irrigation facilities to people.



(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Tamil Nadu Athikadavu Avinashi Scheme 2020
TN Athikadavu Avinashi Scheme will provide irrigation facility to 24,468 acres in drought prone areas and groundwater depleted areas in Erode, Tirupur and Coimbatore districts. Water would be pumped from the Bhavani river. The water bodies to be fed include tanks, ponds and check dams in Erode, Tirupur and Coimbatore districts. These cover Perundurai, Chennimalai, Nambiyur, Gobichettipalayam, Bhavanisagar, Uthukuli, Avinashi, Tirupur, Annur, Sulur, Sarkarsamakulam, Periyanaickenpalayam and Karamadai blocks.

Tamil Nadu Free Laptop Distribution Scheme 2019
In the recent proposal for financial year 2018-2019, govt. has allocated Rs. 758 crore (similar to previous year) for Free Laptop Distribution Scheme. Moreover from this year, education dept. has prepared proposal to include students of class IX and X class in the free laptop scheme and forward it to the central government for financial approval. Previously, this TN free laptop computer scheme was for class XI, XII and college students whose details can be checked at http://117.239.70.115/e2s/. 
The state govt. has so far distributed around 38 lakh free computers under TN free laptop distribution scheme. The state govt. is working out on the total financial cost of the scheme for FY 2019. The issues in laptop scheme goes well beyond financial burden. one of the issue is that if a student gets laptop in class 9 or 10th, then is there a need to give them another laptop in class 11th and class 12th which would reduce financial burden. 


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

TN Free Laptop Computer Scheme – Background
In the current academic year, Lenovo which is a computer manufacturing company has won the tender to distribute 15.66 lakh laptops each at the cost of 10,000 plus tax. As per the school education dept. policy note, govt. has allotted Rs. 758 crore for TN Free Laptop Distribution Scheme 2019. School education authorities are saying this scheme as more than financial burden but there are other issues in this scheme.
This free laptop computer scheme has problems in granting tender, sale of laptops in grey market and poor configuration. In the previous year, same amount was allocated for laptops but only 42,000 students out of 5.3 lakh beneficiaries got these laptops due to the death of former CM Jayalalithaa. This means that the new announcement will provide laptops to an additional 9.6 lakh students of class 9th and 10th. 
Moreover, the laptop computers which would be given to the students has only basic software. Even though, there is an option to install additional features, but the short capacity and speed of laptop does not support it. The laptops could only be used to read or write and nothing else could be done. These laptops are useful for those who are in desperate need of one.
There is a major shortage of computer teachers in high schools and if it continues so, then point of distributing laptops will serve no purpose. For more details, visit the official ELCOT website at http://117.239.70.115/e2s/. Even if the laptops would be provided to students, then who will teach them to use these computers. The high school students studies computer science only as a theory lesson in Science subject.

These glass water bottles are to be distributed across 310 recognized selling points and to AC bus passengers run by State Express Transport Corporation (SETC). The last date to submit bids is 15 November 2019.
Tamilnadu Amma Water Bottle Scheme
Regular bus passengers in Tamil Nadu are quite impressed by 750 ml Amma Water Bottles Scheme. This is because of smaller size of water bottles, lower cost and even glass bottles can be reused in home. The production company may appoint employees to sell Amma Water Bottles inside buses or trains just like private companies. Moreover, these companies may also provide water refilling stations which will further cut bottle cost to Rs. 2 to Rs. 3.
The low cost mineral water scheme was earlier launched in 2013 by late CM J Jayalalithaa. This scheme was later expanded to some government hospitals for patients.

Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Scheme BenefitsKaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project RecordsStage Wise Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Process
Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Scheme is a Telangana government’s gift to the entire India. This is the world’s largest multi-stage multi-purpose lift irrigation scheme coming from the brainchild of CM K Chandrasekhar Rao. The new Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation project is expected to turn the parched and barren outback of Telangana into a verdant land of milk and honey. For the upcoming years, Kaleshwaram will remain a testimony of Telangana’s gift to the nation which is struggling to grow up the GDP ladder.
After solving all the inter state disputes, obtaining all clearances and permissions, overcoming all obstacles strategically within a short duration of 3 years, the Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project is constructed by the Telangana government. Now there would be no more wastelands and no more thirsty throats.
On 21 June 2019, CM KCR will inaugurate the engineering marvel Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project at Medigadda which is moment of pride and honor for India.



(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Scheme Benefits
The major benefits by the Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Scheme are as follows:-

Water is supplied for 2 crops in a year to 45 lakh acres.
40 TMC of water through Mission Bhagiratha to supply safe drinking water daily to each household.
Drinking water to be supplied to 1 crore population in Greater Hyderabad city daily.
Supply of 16 TMC of water to thousands of industries in the state for industrial usage.
Moreover, there is also an opportunity for Hydel power generation.

CM KCR will also switch on the first motor at Kannepally. This is not only the beginning of a new chapter in Telangana but also the beginning of a new book altogether indeed. The 1st book was the “over the decade” movement for Telangana state. The 2nd book in the Telangana’s history is the development through irrigation which will commence through this Kharif season with the inauguration of Kaleshwaram.

Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project Records

Utilization of 139 MW maximum capacity pumps which were never used anywhere in the world.
World’s longest tunnel route of 203 kilometers.
Kaleshwaram is the one and only project which can lift 2 TMC of water everyday. Efforts are on to lift 3 TMC of water from FY 2020.
This is the only project in the world which caters to the water needs of 45 lakh acres of agricultural land, hundreds of industries and drinking water to thousands of villages.
It is for the 1st time that water is lifted from Godavari river in phases from 92 meters height for supply of water to farmland taking it upto 618 meters height.

One of the main reason for construction of Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project is to get state’s legitimate share in river waters. Telangana is geographically located 100 metres above the sea level and could not construct a dam across the Godavari to tap water. In case a huge dam was constructed, almost half of the Telangana and neighbouring Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh would be submerged. So, the CM KCR led Telangana govt. has conceptualised the Kaleshwaram lift irrigation scheme.

Telangana Rythu Bandhu Scheme 2019 Now OnlineNeed to Stop Cheque Distribution of Rythu Bandhu SchemeTelangana Rythu Bandhu Scheme Background
The state government of Telangana has decided to transfer amount under Rythu Bandhu Scheme directly into bank accounts of farmers. Now the Telangana Rythu Bandhu Scheme 2019 has been made online. The state govt. will not issue any more cheques for the farmers as it was done in the 1st & 2nd installments of Rythu Bandhu Yojana 2018. 
CM K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) said that it would be for the first time that an enhanced amount of Rs. 5,000 per acre per season would be distributed. Previously, CM KCR has raised the assistance amount from Rs. 8,000 per acre to Rs. 10,000 per acre in a single year as cash incentive. 
Now process of giving 1st installment for FY 2019 for Kharif season under Rythu Bandhu Scheme in Telangana would be initiated in the last week of May. This decision is taken in a high-level meeting chaired by CM KCR with the top officials of Agriculture and Finance departments recently. 



(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Telangana Rythu Bandhu Scheme 2019 Now Online
Telangana govt. has made Rythu Bandhu Scheme online and govt. will now stop cheque distribution and introduce online payments. Now the state govt. will deposit Rythu Bandhu money directly into the bank accounts of the farmers. In 2018, before the assembly polls, the state govt. had organized meetings and distributed cheques to the farmers. But from FY 2019 onward, the govt. will credit this amount into bank accounts of beneficiaries. 
As per the official report, there are around 54-55 lakh farmers in the state of Telangana. Each farmer will get Rs. 5,000 per acre in last week of May for Kharif season and the next installment of Rs. 5,000 per acre for Rabi season would be given in month of November. The estimated amount required for Rythu Bandhu Scheme for Kharif season is Rs. 7,500 crore. For this purpose, govt. has given directions to finance department to keep money ready till specified time.


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Till date, there are around 5 to 6 lakh farmers who had not given their bank account details to the government. This may be due to non-interest in receiving Rythu Bandhu amounts. Those beneficiaries who are not interested in receiving this amount would save around 700-1000 crore of the government. The state govt. will not deposit the amount into the bank accounts of 54 lakh farmers in a single day. This amount would be credited in a phase wise manner. 
Need to Stop Cheque Distribution of Rythu Bandhu Scheme
In the high level meeting chaired by CM KCR, the officials explained the difficulty faced by the machinery at ground level in distribution of cheques to farmers. Moreover, there is a difficulty in the laborious process involved in the preparation and disbursement of cheques from the state head quarter to the village level.
In view of the enforcement of Model Code of conduct during Lok Sabha election, Election Commission of India has asked the Telangana govt. to stop cheque distribution. Moreover, instructions are given to the Agriculture department to disburse the scheme benefit to the farmers accounts directly through online without any publicity.
Telangana Rythu Bandhu Scheme Background
Telangana govt. has launched Rythu Bandhu Scheme as an investment support scheme for farmers. Initially, the state govt. has decided to provide Rs. 8,000 per year (Rs. 4,000 per acre per season) in FY 2018. But from this year i.e 2019, the state govt. will provide Rs. 10,000 per year (Rs. 5,000 per acre per season). The total requirement of fund for the implementation of the scheme in 2019-20 financial year will be Rs 15,000 crore (Rs. 7,500 cr for each Kharif & Rabi season). Last year, the government earmarked Rs 12,000 crore.
